Q: I`m using PF firewall, can i use bruteblock?
A: Currently bruteblock have no support for the PF firewall, but you
   can use pf and ipfw together without problems. Make ipfw ruleset like this:

ipfw add 10 deny ip from table\(1\) to any
ipfw add 10 deny ip from any to table\(1\)
ipfw add 20 allow all from any to any

and all incoming packets will be checked with ipfw and then go to pf firewall

Q: I want to make my own regular expression, how can i do this?
A: bruteblock uses pcre for the regular expressions handling. 
   PCRE description located at http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt. You need
   to make regexp which match log lines with bruteforce attempts and first (!)
   matched expression in () must match remote ip address. You can test your
   regexp with "pcretest" utility from the pcre distribution.
